# 100 Days of Dora ðŸš€

Welcome to the **100 Dora Metrics Case Studies of God Level Repositories Using Middleware Open Source** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository will serve as a resource hub where each case study is linked, providing a deep understanding of each repo's strong points, their challenges and actionable insights to help engineering teams of all sizes improve their development practices. 

Whether youâ€™re leading a team, writing code, or just curious about what makes successful open source projects tick, this journey will showcase real-world lessons on how we can drive smarter, faster, and better engineering.

Each link below will take you directly to a detailed analysis hosted on our website.

We are using [Middleware Open Source](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware) to build an analysis of each repository. This simply means that if you are curious you can invest a few minutes to set things up locally and dive into any repository yourself as well!
